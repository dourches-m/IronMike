# IronMike

Iron Mike was developped during the december 2017 Ludum Dare.

The team was composed of two developpers (me and baldash), and one graphist (Tartiflexe). It was our first time making a jam on Unity and the result isn't too bad!

# Controls

/!\ The game is only playable with a controller /!\

- Move -> left stick
- Aim  -> right stick
- Light attack -> RT
- Heavy attack -> LT
- Dash -> X (or SQUARE on a ps4 controller)

# How to play

Simply run the executable file at the root of the repository, grab your controller and enjoy ;)

The goal of the game is to push the ennemies outside of the ring and make the highest score.
